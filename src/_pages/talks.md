## Hops - Universal flexible and extensible React applications

[Slides on slidr.io](https://slidr.io/robin-drexler/hops-universal-flexible-and-extensible-react-applications#1)

Hops is a framework that gets you started quickly with your React application, and also allows to customize your application's behavior through various run- and build time hooks without "ejecting" to support more sophisticated use cases.

We will also dive into Hops' architecture and discuss its virtues as well as its shortcomings.

## preconnect, prefetch, preload, pre-what? - An introduction to Resource Hints (November 2017)

[Slides on slidr.io](https://slidr.io/robin-drexler/preconnect-prefetch-preload-pre-what-an-introduction-to-resource-hints#1)

Every millisecond counts when loading websites. Unfortunately, networks are slow, and while browsers got better at finding critical resources, they still need our help.

In this talk, you will learn about “Resource Hints” and how you can use them to make your website load even faster.

Topics that are covered:

- How browsers download resources and why bandwidth often isn’t the bottleneck and cause for slow websites.
- How to speed up page loads by hinting at critical resources that are dynamically loaded, such as web fonts or background images referenced in CSS.
- How to improve the speed of subsequent request by prefetching resources that are going to be needed later.
- How to make sure your site still works in a world where prerendering of entire pages is a reality.
