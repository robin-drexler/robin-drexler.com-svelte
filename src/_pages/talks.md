## 🎯 Hops - Universal flexible and extensible React applications

<p class="card-tagline">Hops is a framework that gets you started quickly with your React application, and also allows to customize your application's behavior through various run- and build time hooks without "ejecting" to support more sophisticated use cases.</p>

We will also dive into Hops' architecture and discuss its virtues as well as its shortcomings.

## ⚡ preconnect, prefetch, preload, pre-what? - An introduction to Resource Hints (November 2017)

<p class="card-tagline">Every millisecond counts when loading websites. Unfortunately, networks are slow, and while browsers got better at finding critical resources, they still need our help.</p>

In this talk, you will learn about "Resource Hints" and how you can use them to make your website load even faster.

Topics that are covered:

- How browsers download resources and why bandwidth often isn't the bottleneck and cause for slow websites.
- How to speed up page loads by hinting at critical resources that are dynamically loaded, such as web fonts or background images referenced in CSS.
- How to improve the speed of subsequent request by prefetching resources that are going to be needed later.
- How to make sure your site still works in a world where prerendering of entire pages is a reality.
