When attempting to close Apple's TextEdit, while still editing an unsaved file, the button that discards the file is labeled **"delete"** instead of the more commonly used **"don't save"** or **"discard"**.
I'm not entirely sure why, but this seemingly small difference makes me think twice before closing the editor, even when I originally intended to discard the file.
