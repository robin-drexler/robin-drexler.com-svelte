I'm a heavy user of keyboard shortcuts, especially while browsing the web. The shortcut to close an open tab in Chrome  is **CMD + W**. That's fine until you think about the fact that there's a global shortcut in OSX to closes any focused app: **CMD+Q**. Unfortunately the W key and the Q key happen to be pretty close to one another, which sometimes results in an accidental browser quit.

That's why Chrome on OSX offers to warn when **CMD+Q** is pressed, instead of closing. If you actually intended to close the browser, you can either hold **CMD+Q** or hit the shortcut again. Chrome will then close.
