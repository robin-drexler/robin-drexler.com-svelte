The Chrome developer tools ship with an [interface to run commands](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/command-menu/) (similar to what's available in vscode).

That's useful to do common tasks like disabling or enabling JavaScript. Which otherwise needs to be done by going through the DevTools settings.

The command interface can be opened with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (or Ctrl on Windows or Linux).
