You can destructure an object directly into a return statement. No need to assign to a `const` first. Never tried this before and just assumed it does not work. ðŸ˜…

```js
const obj = { hello: 'world' };

function greet() {
	return ({ hello } = obj);
}

// logs {hello: 'world'}
console.log(greet());
```
